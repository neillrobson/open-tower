# Development Notes

This file is where I'll put down creative brainstorming for future developments.

## Christmas Customization

* The "peons" will be turtles.
* Turtles will seek out and eat kudzu in their default (jobless) state.
* Building types:
  * Turtle nest: turtles tend to seek out these.
  * Mason: turtles can collect rocks here.
  * Gazebo: Elena and John hang out here.
* Resources:
  * Kudzu: collected by turtles regardless of job.
  * Stone: collected from rocks on ground (path?) and delivered to mason.
    The tower is also rock!
  * Steel: comes from the top of the tower. Used to construct gazebo.
